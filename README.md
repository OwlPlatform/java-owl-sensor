== About ==

The Sensor-Aggregator library is an implementation of the GRAIL
Sensor-Aggregator network protocol for the Java language.  It provides the
ability for a Java application to act as a sensor for the Owl Platform, with
the primary objective of forwarding a stream of Sample messages to the
aggregator.  It fully implements all required and optional components of the
network protocol.

== Dependencies ==

This library depends on the following libraries:
* [Owl Common Library version 1.0.2] (https://github.com/OwlPlatform/java-owl-common/downloads 
  "Owl Common Library Downloads")
* [Apache Mina Core version 2.0.4](http://mina.apache.org/downloads.html
  "Apache Mina Downloads")
* [SLF4J API version 1.6.6](http://www.slf4j.org/download.html "SLF4J
  Downloads")

Optionally, you can provide a binding for the SLF4J facade.  If you don't want
any logging, you can use [SLF4J NOP] v1.6.6, or see the [SLF4J
website](http://www.slf4j.org "Simple Logging Facade for Java") for more
options.


== Compiling ==

This library should be compiled using the Apache Maven project management
tool.  The project is currently compatible with Apache Maven version 3,
which can be downloaded for free at <http://maven.apache.org/>.  To build
the static JAR file output, the following command should be run from the
project root (where the pom.xml file is located):

    mvn clean package -U

If everything compiles correctly, then near the end of the Maven output,
this line should appear:

    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

In this case, the JAR file will be located in the ``target'' subdirectory.
If not, please visit the project website listed at the top of this
document for support.
